<h3 align="left">1. About the Project</h1>
<h4>This project was created in order to confront the challenge given by Aalto University within a hackathon held by Junction 2023</h4>

Problem Story: In Finland and across Europe, the need for dependable and sustainable energy solutions has never been more urgent than ever. Our MooMoo team introduces a pivotal solution. Positioned as a user-friendly intermediary between consumers and electricity providers, our platform revolutionizes energy conservation by offering a platform built in React:

- Real-time Monitoring: Users access a comprehensive dashboard providing insights into electricity usage patterns, spot prices, and predictions for informed energy decisions.

- All-in-One Convenience: Eliminating the need for multiple platforms, our solution consolidates reports from top electricity providers, such as Helen, Fortum, and Caruna, into a single, easily accessible space.

- Bill Estimation: Predict and compare bills, empowering users to make decisions that align with their energy-saving goals.

- Community Engagement: Foster a sense of collective commitment through challenges and rewards, ranked in zones (green, yellow, red) with varying benefits to encourage users in their energy-saving endeavors.

- Data-Driven Insights: Provide actionable information derived from user data for smarter energy consumption decisions.

- Rewarding: By joining the community, the more saving energy by month, the more vouchers/coupons can be delivered to the user

- Future Innovation - Selling Electricity: Explore the idea of buying excess energy generated by users with solar panels, promoting sustainable practices within the EnPals ecosystem.

Through our platform, we want to improve and help a community where even small actions add up to a big positive impact. Our goal is to change how people think about and use energy, making our society more sustainable and energy-smarter.
